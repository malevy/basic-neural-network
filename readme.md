# Basic Neural Network

## _Creating a neural network from scratch_
I wanted to have a better understanding of neural networks. 
Specifically, I wanted to understand the underlying theory.
This library is inspired by a handful of Youtube videos and 
the book Nueral Netoworks from Scratch (https://nnfs.io/).

I've been using this library to explore how NNs can be used to
solve categorical and regression problems.

### Status
This code works enough to explore the inner workings of a neural network.
I cannot recommend using this library for any production workloads.
There are more appropriate libraries out there that should be 
used in those scenarios.

Additionally, I cannot guarantee that I got all the math correct.
The math used during the training phase can get complicated.
